Synopsis
========
This is a cross-platform common library (CPCommon) that allows for cross-platform (e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android) applications to be written in a cross-architecture way. Currently supported architectures are x86, x64, ARM and ARM64. 

The goal of this library is to provide an abstraction to the platform-specific system-level API calls and provide a unified interface that cross-platform code can be written on top of without making platform-specific system-level calls.
